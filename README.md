## Reference System  

The Reference System Service is hosted on a secure Public Commercial Cloud and provides 3 operational functions:

- environment to assure the test, integration, validation, benchmarking of Sentinel Data Processors (new processor versions, new user level data, new Sentinel units);
- sampled systematic Production and Distribution Service;
- ad-hoc Production and Distribution Service.


This software is the exact complement of the ESA-driven Sentinel Data Processors. It provides all the components to integrate them in processing chains and to distribute the output products.
