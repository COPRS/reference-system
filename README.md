# Getting started using the GitHub CI 

## Enable the Gitub Action 

On the root of the repo, create a folder called `.github`. 
Inside this folder, create another folder called `workflows`

Inside the `workflows` folder, paste [this GitHub Action configuration](.github/workflows/python-pip-ci.yaml)
Then push your modifications


To understand the configuration file, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/features/actions)
