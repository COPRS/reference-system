## Reference System  

The Reference System Service is hosted on a secure Public Commercial Cloud and provides 3 operational functions:

- sampled systematic Production and Distribution Service;
- ad-hoc Production and Distribution Service;
- environment to assure the test, integration, validation, benchmarking of Sentinel Data Processors (new processor versions, new user level data, new Sentinel units).

This software is the exact complement of the ESA-driven Sentinel Data Processors. It provides all the components to integrate them in processing chains and to distribute the output products.
