Dear End-User,

I, Adrien ESCOURROU, as a Licence Compliance Specialist at Airbus Defence and Space SAS, confirm that the COPRS project complies with the licensing legislation and that the content has been reviewed and certified.
On the other hand, you (as an End-User) had to be warned of the following limitations and conditions of use of the COPRS Software:

Concerning,
Elastic License software:
(Kibana, Elasticsearch etc.)

The license allows the free right to use, modify, create derivative works, and redistribute, with three simple limitations:

• You may not provide the products to others as a managed service
• You may not circumvent the license key functionality or remove/obscure features protected by license keys
• You may not remove or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices

"The licensor grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to use, copy, distribute, make available, and prepare derivative works of the software, in each case subject to the limitations and conditions below. "

As long as the RS is re-used to host a service (e.g. a Sentinel Data Production Service) without changing its external APIs (PRIP/Odata and STAC), then there is no need to purchase an Elastic license. If the RS solution is modified in a way that would violate the limitations given above, then the purchase of an Elastic License would be necessary.

AGPL software:
(Grafana & Loki)
You must buy a license if you distribute it for a commercial usage.

SSPL software:
(Graylog & MongoDB)

Allows free and unrestricted use, modification, and redistribution, with the simple requirement that if you provide the product as a service to others, you must also publicly release any modifications as well as the source code of your management layers under SSPL.
Moreover, if you use the source code and create derivative works, those derivative works must also be licensed under SSPL and released publicly.
Section 13 of the SSPL reads as follows:
a. “If you make the functionality of the Program or a modified version available to third parties as a service, you must make the Service Source Code available via network download to everyone at no charge, under the terms of this License. Making the functionality of the Program or modified version available to third parties as a service includes, without limitation, enabling third parties to interact with the functionality of the Program or modified version remotely through a computer network, offering a service the value of which entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Program or modified version, or offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the Software or modified version.”
b. “Service Source Code” means the Corresponding Source for the Program or the modified version, and the Corresponding Source for all programs that you use to make the Program or modified version available as a service, including, without limitation, management software, user interfaces, application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software, backup software, storage software and hosting software, all such that a user could run an instance of the service using the Service Source Code you make available.”

For now, in COPRS SW these softwares are just databases so it is compliant, but if you modify the use, in order to avoid this case, you can buy a license.
